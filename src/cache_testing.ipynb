      "The first goal feels like I got there. As hoped, just being around a bunch of amazing programmers where I can incidentally here what everyone is working on, has been fantastically helpful for me.\n",
      "The second goal is still out of reach, but perhaps this second half will give me the time to really buckle down and get there. I think, coming in, my coding abilities were at a point where I could probably hack a way together to achieve most things I wanted to do, but I couldn't do anything quickly, efficiently, or in an easily debuggable fashion.\n",
      "I remember and interview question where someone asked me would feel like a success coming away from RC. I said that it would be if I had disavowed myself of one of those technical macho ideologies that I am sure I didn't have. I think I'm getting there, letting go of \n",

If I magically returned to the start I would have learned rust instead of burning time with C++ dependencies, but then I would have never had the perspective I needed on why I don't want to wade through the cultural and technical baggage of C++. Also I probably wouldn't have paired with Ishan and Pierre as much, and my project wouldn't have been as finished.\n",
      "I always feel like I wish I focused more. I wish that I wasn't as distracted when I'm programming, that I had that wild laser focus I see in people around me. I feel like I'm burning lots of time in 30 second increments on reddit, checking texts, checking instagram, wandering downstairs to get a coffee.

I feel comfortable saying that I am a programmer. I don't feel like my code is embarrassingly bad, or novicelike, or my ideas are sophomoric. This confidence lets me share repos and ask for feedback, which lets me grow.\n",

All I need is a few friends and a laptop. These skills are transferable. The more math, philosophy and science I learn the more I can explore and build. I will focus on skills that are transferable.

      " What were your goals, what did you expect to work on , what did you actually work on\n",
      "I expected to work on graphics things and then, eventually, ML stuff. I fell entirely into graphics, I didn't really do any ML things at all. I think I underestimated not only how vast graphics is, but also how interesting and esoteric it can get. I also think I had some early ambitions to do more videooriented things/art but I never really got to those. I think 3D just proved to be too interesting to pass up. I did not expect to learn Rust, nor did I expect to spend so much time on it. I was hoping to have more of a finished product (other than spritefire) by the end of the batch, but I think part of working on the edge of my abilities meant really digging into some headsdownnerdy and radio silent kind of work; like trying to get a graphics pipeline set up in WGPU. I'm very thankful that my linear algebra skills came in handy.\n",
      " Something You're Really Proud Of\n",
      "I feel like I can work with programmers now! Although Ishan will be a good test of this when we reintegrate spritefire. I feel like I can say that I can program, that I'm approaching this point where I was in film where, even if I don't know how to do something I can probably figure out how to ask for help.\n",
      "I'm proud of running a graphics meetup that people seemed to get something out of. I'm really proud of figuring out how to render a cube. Very proud of spritefire, although feeling real fatigue when it comes to the prospect of maintaining it.\n",
      "I'm proud that I have found a little corner of computer science where I feel like I have something to contribute. In retrospect, that is the result of almost a year of work since I quit my job.\n",
      " What do you wish you'd done differently\n",
      "I wish I had paired more. It was absolutely the thing that helped me get unstuck when I tried it. I think I came in with so much film industry baggage; feeling like there would be some kind of huge catch if I worked on something with someone; that there would be weird authorship drama. This seems amazingly absent at RC.\n",
      "I also wish I had started a CTF group for the second half. So many of the best groups were MC'd by people who didn't have much expertise in the specific in the field; they just opened the space and let people work.\n",
      " How have you grown at RC and how do you want to keep growing?\n",
      "I'm finally a programmer! I know this is a nebulous definition, it's hard to say what makes a person a programmer, but I do feel like I am more of one now than when I was where I started. I want to keep growing by becoming a good programmer.\n",
      " Set an Intention for after RC\n",
      "Build more things out in the big scary world. Take the confidence and skills you have acquired here and use them to make stuff out where things are harder; like a disorganized grad program, sharky VC setting, or less than supportive work environment. The world is going to be scary and imperfect, far harder to deal with than the oasis of RC. I want to thrive out there.\n",

That‚Äôs significantly cheaper than an employee, but meaningful enough to contribute to a total that‚Äôs competitive with the US senior software engineer market.

This prompt would be a piece of art created with tactile media like oil paint, clay, tapestry, etc. We would use the time to code patterns, colors, shapes that are found in the art. The idea is that we would figure out ways to program shaders that replicate techniques found in physical mediums.  It's a bit like the William Turner prompt in page 6 The Book of Shaders. I think this would be a great exercise for people of all levels of coding and we could learn a lot from each others code.\n",

      "\t If the user can implement the feature themselves with the code you provided (such as tuning the alpha ahead of time and then setting the bool to off), then that feature is not a priority (call it priority 0%)\n",
      "\t If the feature needs to be implemented in the source code for it to exist (like a neural net match of sprites), then this is a priority (priority 100%)\n",
      "\t This is a sliding scale: a custom sprite database creator is hard for the user to implement but doable, so I'd say that's a priority 60%\n",

      "The first goal feels like I got there. As hoped, just being around a bunch of amazing programmers where I can incidentally here what everyone is working on, has been fantastically helpful for me.\n",
      "The second goal is still out of reach, but perhaps this second half will give me the time to really buckle down and get there. I think, coming in, my coding abilities were at a point where I could probably hack a way together to achieve most things I wanted to do, but I couldn't do anything quickly, efficiently, or in an easily debuggable fashion.\n",
      "I remember and interview question where someone asked me would feel like a success coming away from RC. I said that it would be if I had disavowed myself of one of those technical macho ideologies that I am sure I didn't have. I think I'm getting there, letting go of \n",

If I magically returned to the start I would have learned rust instead of burning time with C++ dependencies, but then I would have never had the perspective I needed on why I don't want to wade through the cultural and technical baggage of C++. Also I probably wouldn't have paired with Ishan and Pierre as much, and my project wouldn't have been as finished.\n",
      "I always feel like I wish I focused more. I wish that I wasn't as distracted when I'm programming, that I had that wild laser focus I see in people around me. I feel like I'm burning lots of time in 30 second increments on reddit, checking texts, checking instagram, wandering downstairs to get a coffee. I think that's it, but perhaps that's more of wishing I was different than wishing \n",

      " How have you grown, how do you want to keep growing\n",
      "I now feel comfortable that I can tackle most projects. I know that if I don't know something I can probably figure out how to get help with it. I feel comfortable saying that I am a programmer. I don't feel like my code is embarrassingly bad, or novicelike, or my ideas are sophomoric. This confidence lets me share repos and ask for feedback, which lets me grow.\n",
      "I want to now tackle things that realer, bigger, harder. I want to sharpen my focus to efficiently learn the prerequisites needed for any task.

All I need is a few friends and a laptop. These skills are transferable. The more math, philosophy and science I learn the more I can explore and build. I will focus on skills that are transferable.

      " What were your goals, what did you expect to work on , what did you actually work on\n",
      "I expected to work on graphics things and then, eventually, ML stuff. I fell entirely into graphics, I didn't really do any ML things at all. I think I underestimated not only how vast graphics is, but also how interesting and esoteric it can get. I also think I had some early ambitions to do more videooriented things/art but I never really got to those. I think 3D just proved to be too interesting to pass up. I did not expect to learn Rust, nor did I expect to spend so much time on it. I was hoping to have more of a finished product (other than spritefire) by the end of the batch, but I think part of working on the edge of my abilities meant really digging into some headsdownnerdy and radio silent kind of work; like trying to get a graphics pipeline set up in WGPU. I'm very thankful that my linear algebra skills came in handy.\n",
      " Something You're Really Proud Of\n",
      "I feel like I can work with programmers now! Although Ishan will be a good test of this when we reintegrate spritefire. I feel like I can say that I can program, that I'm approaching this point where I was in film where, even if I don't know how to do something I can probably figure out how to ask for help.\n",
      "I'm proud of running a graphics meetup that people seemed to get something out of. I'm really proud of figuring out how to render a cube. Very proud of spritefire, although feeling real fatigue when it comes to the prospect of maintaining it.\n",
      "I'm proud that I have found a little corner of computer science where I feel like I have something to contribute. In retrospect, that is the result of almost a year of work since I quit my job.\n",
      " What do you wish you'd done differently\n",
      "I wish I had paired more. It was absolutely the thing that helped me get unstuck when I tried it. I think I came in with so much film industry baggage; feeling like there would be some kind of huge catch if I worked on something with someone; that there would be weird authorship drama. This seems amazingly absent at RC.\n",
      "I also wish I had started a CTF group for the second half. So many of the best groups were MC'd by people who didn't have much expertise in the specific in the field; they just opened the space and let people work.\n",
      " How have you grown at RC and how do you want to keep growing?\n",
      "I'm finally a programmer! I know this is a nebulous definition, it's hard to say what makes a person a programmer, but I do feel like I am more of one now than when I was where I started. I want to keep growing by becoming a good programmer.\n",
      " Set an Intention for after RC\n",
      "Build more things out in the big scary world. Take the confidence and skills you have acquired here and use them to make stuff out where things are harder; like a disorganized grad program, sharky VC setting, or less than supportive work environment. The world is going to be scary and imperfect, far harder to deal with than the oasis of RC. I want to thrive out there.\n",

      "the gist:\n",
      "I'm very honored with Ethan's enthusiasm and it's great that he's put me in contact with so many people. Also very excited that he wants to use the software in his film. However, no matter what I say he keeps mentioning businesses and investors. I'm feeling increasingly uncomfortable with this, and many of my friends and coworkers are seeing tons of red flags here. I am worried that he's selling my still in progress, and totally open source software as something that is very polished and poised to become a startup. \n",

      " The Call\n",
      " He's a fun person, good network, some nuggets of wisdom. But I've found it somewhat challenging to do business with him.\n",
      " He tried to become the CD of David's company when hooking him up with people\n",
      " Digging into details is complicated with him\n",
      " He probably doesn't understand open source\n",
      " His main motivation is he has a production company and wants to make good images\n",
      " He's heard complaints, but never screwed anyone\n",
      " He doesn't have a big source of funding right now, as he has had in the past\n",
      "\n",
      " Pitch back to him: it's open source. If you want investment based on a production company based around this project, then you can just get the funding yourself and you don't need me\n",
      "\n",
      " Used to have connections with shell, etc, who showered him with money which he spread around\n",
      "\n",
      " You're probably pretty safe, nobody is going to spread your name around or steal your idea, just be really clear that you don't want that to happen\n",
      "\n",
      " Don't tiptoe around things; just say you aren't comfortable with x y z, set clear limits, he'll be find\n",
      "\n",
      " David had a big blow up with him last year, wound up being super stressful, they didn't talk for a bit but now they're good.\n",

      "\n",
      "I am very excited for you to use Neurovolume in any documentaries you are making! I am likewise very happy at the thought of Stanford or any other academic institution using this software for visualizations in their research papers. Thank you again for putting those contacts together.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am absolutely down to walk you, Andrew, or anyone other potential users, through my visualization pipeline pipeline. Likewise, my offer still stands to render out some initial sequences for you and Andrew to use in studies or documentaries once I have a minimum viable product that clearly illustrates brain activity in a meaningful way. You can track my progress in the project's repo's branches.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I am not okay with this software being pitched as anything that may become closed source or commercialized. As I mentioned earlier, I have also decided to not pursue corporate or nonprofit sponsors. I do not intend to cede any creative, technical, or logistical control on this project. I am considering applying a more restrictive license to legally prohibit any closed source forks of this project.\n",
      "\n",
      "In brief, I intend for this tool to always be available for anyone to use, modify, break, and rebuild in the service of illustrating and understanding brain activity. This project should not be represented as having any commercial value. Not only would that be against my wishes, it would be deeply disingenuous to whoever is being pitched to.\n",
