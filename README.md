# Daily Note Organizer

## Overview
The Daily Note Organizer is a Python script designed to organize and aggregate daily notes stored in markdown files within an Obsidian vault. It sorts notes by year and month, creating a structured overview in a single markdown file.

## Usage and Instructions
To regenerate the file, navigate to the local file path and run `daily_note_org.py` using Python 3.11 (as specified in the Poetry environment)

Note that **this project currently uses all hard coded paths** and will have to be modified if any of those change.

I recommend **pausing obsidian sync before running this script**

## To-Do
- [ ] Get rid of virtual environment
- [ ] Make portable
- [ ] Auto install on path


# Thoughts On Summarizer
- Perhaps we should start by splitting into two sections along the biggest notes, drill down from there?
