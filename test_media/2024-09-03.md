# To-Do
- [x] Start Dev for [[Neurovolume]] in [[Docker]] file
	- [ ] If this takes a while to build, work on [[Introduction to Statistics]]
	- [ ] Main goal: [[fMRI]] sequence from Open Neuro project which shows un-blurred brain anatomy
	- This dataset is pretty good looking: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003548/versions/1.0.1
		- [ ] Use [[VDB]] color and emission to show activations, not a layered VDB
- [ ] Ask in Zulip about running/funding OSS stuff
	- What is the typical plan for running an open source project? I know from @filippo's [blogpost](https://words.filippo.io/full-time-maintainer/) that it is possible to build out a career, but he's pretty experienced and had a lot more projects under his belt. Is it the sort of thing that just helps getting jobs?


# Status as of Lunch
- Dockerfile does work but needed setup within vscode. I wonder what the best way to maintain all of this with the two githubs linked? Perhaps a question for Zach Lipp
- Forgot to add `nilearn` to neurovolume deps,

# To-Do Afternoon
- [x] Add nilearn to docker file
- [x] Push these changes to openvdb_docker
- [ ] Continue building fMRI sequence in open neuro with this vdb integrated
	- [ ] 86 the blender scripts and binaries, integrate this into your code base
- [ ] Follow up with Zach if/when the numpy support build works

# Notes
- [[Docker]] cp `docker cp ./some_file CONTAINER:/work`
	- https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/cp/


- `nib.load()` indeed does not like `.nii.gz` files, despite the [documentation](https://nipy.org/nibabel/gettingstarted.html)
- Perhaps you didn't download correctly. Trying again with `openneuro download --snapshot 1.0.1 ds003548 ds003548-download/`
- **This is indeed the case, the new download command above worked perfectly!**

- Rebuilding container with numpy support, this kind of thing is a big-ish question for dev-ops re: Zach Zulip messages.
